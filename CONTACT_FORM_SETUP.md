# Contact Form Setup Documentation

## Overview
The contact form is now fully integrated with Nodemailer to send emails to **latakshsariya146@gmail.com**

## How It Works

### 1. **Contact Form (ContactPage.jsx)**
- User fills out the form with: Name, Email, Phone, Subject, Message
- On submit, form data is sent to `/api/nodemailer` endpoint
- Shows loading spinner while sending
- Displays success/error message after submission
- Form resets automatically on successful submission

### 2. **API Endpoint (api/nodemailer.js)**
- Receives POST request with form data
- Uses Gmail SMTP service to send emails
- Sends formatted HTML email to: **latakshsariya146@gmail.com**
- Email includes all form fields with professional formatting
- Reply-To is set to user's email for easy responses

### 3. **Email Configuration**
- **Service**: Gmail SMTP
- **From**: nodemailer424@gmail.com
- **To**: latakshsariya146@gmail.com
- **Reply-To**: User's email (for easy replies)

## Email Format
The recipient will receive a beautifully formatted email with:
- Sender's Name
- Sender's Email (with reply-to capability)
- Phone Number (if provided)
- Subject
- Message
- Professional HTML styling with your brand colors

## Features Implemented

‚úÖ **Form Validation**: Required fields (Name, Email, Subject, Message)
‚úÖ **Loading State**: Shows spinner and "Sending..." while processing
‚úÖ **Success Feedback**: Green message confirming email sent
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Red message if something goes wrong with fallback email
‚úÖ **Form Reset**: Automatically clears form on successful submission
‚úÖ **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on all devices
‚úÖ **Professional Email**: HTML formatted email with brand styling
‚úÖ **Reply-To**: Easy for you to reply directly to the sender

## Testing

### Local Testing:
1. Run your development server
2. Go to the Contact page
3. Fill out and submit the form
4. Check **latakshsariya146@gmail.com** inbox

### Production (Vercel):
- The API route will work automatically when deployed to Vercel
- No environment variables needed (credentials are in the code)
- Vercel.json is configured to handle API routes properly

## Security Note
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The Gmail credentials are currently hardcoded in the API file. For production, consider:
1. Moving credentials to environment variables
2. Using Vercel Environment Variables in the dashboard
3. Enabling 2FA and using App Passwords for Gmail

## Troubleshooting

### If emails aren't sending:
1. Check Gmail account (nodemailer424@gmail.com) hasn't been blocked
2. Verify the App Password is still valid
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Check Vercel function logs if deployed

### If form shows error:
- User will see a helpful error message with your direct email
- They can contact you at: latakshsariya146@gmail.com

## Files Modified

1. **api/nodemailer.js** - Fixed syntax error, added all form fields, improved email template
2. **ContactPage.jsx** - Added form submission logic, loading states, status messages
3. **vercel.json** - Added API route configuration

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. **Add Email Notifications**: Send auto-reply to user confirming receipt
2. **Add reCAPTCHA**: Prevent spam submissions
3. **Database Storage**: Store submissions in a database for backup
4. **Email Templates**: Create more sophisticated email templates
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with rate limiting
